# # Project 8: Going to the Movies

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate how to:
#
# * integrate relevant information from various sources (e.g. multiple csv files),
# * build appropriate data structures for organized and informative presentation (e.g. list of dictionaries),
# * practice good coding style.
#
# Please go through [Lab-P8](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p8) before working on this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `public_tests.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# <h2 style="color:red">Warning (Note on Academic Misconduct):</h2>
#
# **IMPORTANT**: **P8 and P9 are two parts of the same data analysis.** You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects. That is if you partner up with someone for P8, you have to sustain that partnership until the end of P9. Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f23/syllabus.html).
#
# Under any circumstances, **no more than two students are allowed to work together on a project** as mentioned in the course policies. If your code is flagged by our code similarity detection tools, **both partners will be responsible** for sharing/copying the code, even if the code is shared/copied by one of the partners with/from other non-partner student(s). Note that each case of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students with a zero grade on the project. **If you think that someone cannot be your project partner then donâ€™t make that student your lab partner.**

# ## Introduction:
#
# In this project and the next, we will be working on the [IMDb Movies Dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/). We will use Python to discover some cool facts about our favorite movies, cast, and directors.
#
# In this project, you will combine the data from the movie and mapping files into a more useful format.
# Start by downloading the following files: `public_tests.py`, `small_mapping.csv`, `small_movies.csv`, `mapping.csv`, and `movies.csv`.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## The Data:
#
# Open `movies.csv` and `mapping.csv` in any spreadsheet viewer, and see what the data looks like.
# `movies.csv` has ~75,000 rows and `mapping.csv` has ~220,000 rows. These files store information about **every** movie on the IMDb dataset which was released in the US, and received over **250** reviews on IMDb. These datasets are **very** large when compared to `small_movies.csv` and `small_mapping.csv` from [Lab-P8](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p8), but the data is stored in the **same format**. For a description of the datasets, please refer back to [Lab-P8](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p8).
#
# Before we start working with these very large datasets, let us start with the much smaller datasets, `small_movies.csv` and `small_mapping.csv` from Lab-P8. In the latter half of P8 and in P9, you will be working with `movies.csv` and `mapping.csv`. Since the files `movies.csv` and `mapping.csv` are large, some of the functions you write in P8 and P9 **may take a while to execute**. You do not have to panic if a single cell takes between 5 to 10 seconds to run. If any cell takes significantly longer, follow the recommendations below:
#
# - **Do not** call **slow functions** multiple times within a loop.
# - **Do not** call functions that **iterate over the entire dataset within a loop**; instead, call the function before the loop and store the result in a variable.
# - **Do not** compute quantities **inside a loop** if it can be computed outside the loop; for example, if you want to calculate the average of a list, you should use the loop to find the numerator and denominator but divide **once** after the loop ends instead of inside the loop.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code, unless the question explicitly asks you to do so. If you open your `.csv` files with Excel, manually count through the rows and use this number to loop through the dataset, this is also considered as hardcoding. If any instances of hardcoding are found during code review, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Functions:
# - `get_mapping`
# - `get_raw_movies`
# - `get_movies`
# - `find_specific_movies`
# - `bucketize_by_genre`
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Data Structures:
# - `small_movies_data`
# - `movies`
# - `genre_dict`
#
# You are only allowed to define these data structures **once** and the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score if you redefine the values of these variables.
#
# In this project (and the next), you will be asked to create **lists** of movies. For all such questions, **unless it is explicitly mentioned otherwise**, the movies should be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` (or `small_movies.csv`) file. Similarly, for each movie, the **list** of `genres`, `directors`, and `cast` members should always be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` (or `small_movies.csv`) file.
#
# Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P8. Therefore, you should not use the pandas module. The Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score otherwise.
#
# In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:
# - **Do not use the method `csv.DictReader` for P8**. Although the required output can be obtained using this method, one of the learning outcomes of this project is to demonstrate your ability to build dictionaries with your own code.  
# - Additional import statements beyond those that are stated in the directions are not allowed. For this project, we allow you to use `csv` and `copy` packages (that is, you can use the `import csv` and `import copy` statements in your submission). You should not use concepts / modules that are yet to be covered in this course; for example: you should **not** use modules like `pandas`.
#
# The Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points accordingly, if you don't follow the provided directions.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p8/rubric.md).

# This function takes in a keyword like a substring of a title, a genre, or the name of a person, and returns a list of relevant movies with that title, genre, or cast member/director.
#
# **Warning:** As `movies` is very large, the function `find_specific_movies` may take five to ten seconds to run. This is normal and you should not panic if it takes a while to run.

# **Important:** While it might look as if we are making it easy for you by providing `find_specific_movies`, there is a catch! There is a subtle flaw with the way the function is defined, that will cause you issues in the next two questions. If you can spot this flaw by just observing the definition of `find_specific_movies`, congratulations! Since you are **not** allowed to modify the function definition, you will have to be a little clever with your function arguments to sidestep the flaw with the function definition.
#
# If you don't see anything wrong with the function just yet, don't worry about it. Solve Question 14 and Question 15 as you normally would, and see if you notice anything suspicious about your answers.

# **Question 14:** List all the movies involving *Alfred Hitchcock*.
#
# Your answer **must** be a **list** of **dictionaries**.
#
# You **must** answer this question by calling `find_specific_movies` with the keyword `"Alfred Hitchcock"`.
#
# The `find_specific_movies` function is expected to take around 5 seconds or more to run, so do not panic if it takes so long to run.
#
# Remember that you are **not** allowed to modify the definition of `find_specific_movies`. You will need to cleverly pass arguments to `find_specific_movies` (in both Question 14 and Question 15) to ensure that `movies` does not get modified by the function calls. Take a look at the Lecture Slides from October 25 for more hints. You will have to Restart and Run all your cells to see the correct output after you fix your answer for Question 14 (and Question 15).
