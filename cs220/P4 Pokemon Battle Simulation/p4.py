# ## Project 4: Pokemon Battle Simulation

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate how to
#
# * Use conditional statements to implement decisions,
# * Write functions using parameters, return values, and conditional logic,
# * Use good coding practices as outlined in Lab-P4.
#
# **Please go through [Lab-P4](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p4) before working on this project.** The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `public_tests.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Description:
#
# For this project, you'll be using the data from `pokemon_stats.csv` and `type_effectiveness_stats.csv` to simulate Pokemon battles and to check the compatibility for friendships between different Pokemon. This data was gathered by the Python program `gen_csv.ipynb` from the website https://www.pokemondb.net/.
#
# * To start, download `project.py`, `public_tests.py`, `type_effectiveness_stats.csv`, and `pokemon_stats.csv`.
# * You'll do all your work on this notebook, and turn it into Gradescope just as you did for the previous projects.
#
# We won't explain how to use the project module here (the code in the `project.py` file), or the dataset that you will be working with. The lab this week is designed to teach you how it works. So, before starting P4, take a look at Lab-P4.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
#
# You **may not** hardcode any answers in your code. Otherwise, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Functions:
# - `damage`
# - `type_bonus`
# - `get_num_types`
# - `effective_damage`
# - `num_hits`
# - `battle`
# - `friendship_score`
#
# In this project, you will have to write several functions and keep adding more details to them according to the instructions. When you are adding more things to your functions, you **must** follow the **Good Coding Style for Functions** described in [Lab-P4](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p4). Therefore, you **must only** keep the latest version of your functions in your notebook file. You can do this by **replacing** your old function definition with the new one after you have confirmed that the new one works.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Questions and Functions:
#
# Let us start by importing all the modules we will need for this project.

# +
# it is considered a good coding practice to place all import statements at the top of the notebook

# please place all your import statements in this cell if you need to import 
# any more modules for this project

# ## Rules for Pokemon battles:
#
# Now, here are the *rules* governing Pokemon battles:
#
# 1. A Pokemon battle takes place between **two** Pokemon.
# 2. The two Pokemon **take turns** attacking each other.
# 3. The Pokemon with the higher **Speed** stat attacks first.
# 4. On each turn, the attacking Pokemon can choose between two modes of attack - **Physical** or **Special**.
# 5. In addition to the attack mode, each Pokemon can choose the **type** of its attack.
# 6. Based on the move chosen by the attacking Pokemon, the defending Pokemon receives damage to its **HP**.
# 7. If a Pokemon's **HP** drops to (or below) 0, it **faints**.
# 8. A Pokemon **wins** the battle if its opponent faints first.
# 9. If both Pokemon faint at the **same time**, or if neither Pokemon is able to damage the other, the battle is a **draw**.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# Throughout this project, we will break this down into smaller parts and slowly build up to the `battle` function. Eventually the `battle` function will determine the outcome of a battle between any two Pokemon.
#
# The first thing we need to do is **calculate the damage** caused by one Pokemon's attack on another Pokemon. To accomplish this, we need to create the function `damage`.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Function 1: `damage(attack, defender)`
#
# The `attacker` can choose between two attack modes - **Physical** or **Special**. The damage caused by the attacker's **Physical** move is `10 * Attack stat of Attacker / Defense stat of Defender`, and the damage caused by the attacker's **Special** move is `10 * Sp. Atk. stat of Attacker / Sp. Def. stat of Defender`.
#
# **If the attacker wants to win, it should always choose the move which will do more damage.** So, that is what we want our function `damage` to do. We want this function to find out which mode of attack the attacker would choose, and return the damage that the attacker would do to the defender.
#
# Use the following code snippet and fill in the details to complete the `damage` function.
# -

def damage(attacker, defender):
    # TODO: replace the ... with your code
    physical_damage = 10 * project.get_attack(attacker) / project.get_defense(defender)
    special_damage = 10 * project.get_sp_atk(attacker) / project.get_sp_def(defender)
    if physical_damage > special_damage:
        return physical_damage
    else:
        return special_damage

# Now, let's find out if this function works. You **must** use the `damage` function to answer the next two questions.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# **Question 1:** How much damage does `Tinkaton` do to `Arcanine`?

# +
# replace the ... with your code
damage_lucario_klawf = damage("Lucario", "Klawf")

damage_lucario_klawf

# + deletable=false editable=false
grader.check("q2")

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# In addition to choosing the attack **mode** (i.e. **Physical** or **Special**), the attacker can also (sometimes) choose the **type** of attack. Before we figure out what type the attacker should choose, we first need to find out the *effect* of the attack on the defender. Each attack type offers a **type bonus** to the attack damage that we calculated with the `damage` function.
#
# If the attacker chooses an attack of type `attack_type` against a defender with only one type, `type1` (i.e. its `type2` is `DNE`), then the **type bonus** of this attack is `get_type_effectiveness(attack_type, type1)`. If the defender has two types `type1` and `type2`, then the **type bonus** of this attack is `get_type_effectiveness(attack_type, type1) * get_type_effectiveness(attack_type, type2)`.
#
# For example, let the `attack_type` be `Bug` and the defender be the Pokemon `Charmander`. `Charmander` has only one type, `Fire` (with its `type2` being `DNE`). In this case, we see that
# -

# the effectiveness of Bug against Fire is...
project.get_type_effectiveness("Bug", "Fire")

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# Therefore, the type bonus of a `Fire` type attack on `Charmander` is `0.5`. On the other hand, consider a `Fire` type attack on the Pokemon `Bulbasaur`. `Bulbasaur` has 2 types, `Grass` and `Poison`. In this case, we see that
# -

# the effectiveness of Fire against Grass is...
project.get_type_effectiveness("Fire", "Grass")

# the effectiveness of Fire against Poison is...
project.get_type_effectiveness("Fire", "Poison")


# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# Therefore, the type bonus of a `Fire` type attack on `Bulbasaur` is the product of these two numbers `2.0 * 1.0 = 2.0`.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Function 2: `type_bonus(attack_type, defender)`
# We are now ready to write the definition of the `type_bonus` function, which will calculate the type bonus of an `attack_type` against a `defender`. We have provided a code snippet for you to work with. You may rewrite the entire function from scratch if you want to.
# -

def type_bonus(attack_type, defender):
    # TODO: store the `type1` and `type2` of the `defender` in variables 
    #       `defender_type1` and `defender_type2`
    # TODO: replace the ... with your code
    defender_type1 = project.get_type1(defender)
    defender_type2 = project.get_type2(defender)

    if defender_type2 == "DNE":
        bonus = project.get_type_effectiveness(attack_type, defender_type1)
        return bonus
    else:
        bonus = project.get_type_effectiveness(attack_type, defender_type1) * project.get_type_effectiveness(attack_type, defender_type2)

# When an `attacker` chooses an attack of type `attack_type` against a `defender`, the damage done is `type_bonus(attack_type, defender) * damage(attacker, defender)`.
#
# An attacker can choose between any of its types for its attack type. So, if an attacker has two types, it can choose **either** type 1 or type 2 as its attack type. However, if it has only one type (i.e. its `type2` is `DNE`), it has **no choice** but to choose type 1 as its attack type. For example, a Pokemon like `Stufful` which has two types (`Normal` and `Fighting`) can choose to make its attack either `Normal` type or `Fighting` type. On the other hand, a Pokemon like `Magikarp` which has only one type (`Water`) can only make its attack a `Water` type attack.
#
# While a Pokemon with only one type doesn't have a choice, **a Pokemon with two types can choose its attack between its two types**. If the attacker wants to win, it should always choose the type which will do more damage.
#
# Let us consider the case when an **attacker has only one type**. (i.e. `type2` is `DNE`). To illustrate this, we take `Magikarp` as the attacker and `Cinderace` as the defender. Let us first ensure that `Magikarp` has only 1 type.
# -

# type1 of Magikarp is...
project.get_type1("Magikarp")

# and type2 of Magikarp is...
project.get_type2("Magikarp")

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# In this case, we simply take the `type_bonus` of the first type against `Cinderace` (the defender).

# +
# so the bonus that Magikarp gets against Cinderace is...
bonus = type_bonus(project.get_type1("Magikarp"), "Cinderace")

bonus

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# If your `type_bonus` function works correctly, `bonus` should have the value `2.0`. To calculate the **effective damage** that Magikarp does to Cinderace, we just have to compute `damage("Magikarp", "Cinderace") * 2.0`

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# We will now consider the case where an **attacker has two types**.
#
# To illustrate this, we take `Stufful` as the `attacker` and `Lucario` as the `defender`. The type bonus of the two types of `Stufful` against `Cinderace` are as follows:

# +
# the type bonus of type1 (Normal) of Stufful against Lucario is...
bonus_type1 = type_bonus(project.get_type1("Stufful"), "Lucario")

bonus_type1

# +
# and the type bonus of type2 (Fighting) of Stufful against Lucario is...
bonus_type2 = type_bonus(project.get_type2("Stufful"), "Lucario")

bonus_type2


# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# If your `type_bonus` function works correctly, then `bonus_type1` should have the value `0.5`, and `bonus_type2` should have the value `2.0`. Clearly, `Stufful`'s second type (`Fighting`) causes more damage to `Lucario` than its first type (`Normal`). So, **`Stufful` would choose its `Fighting` type attack instead of its `Normal` type attack against `Lucario`**.
#
# Therefore, the **effective** `bonus` is `max(0.5, 2.0) = 2.0`. So, the **effective damage** that `Stufful` does to `Lucario` is `damage("Stufful", "Lucario") * 2.0`.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Function 3: `effective_damage(attacker, defender)`
#
# We now write a function `effective_damage` to compute the actual damage that an `attacker` would do to the `defender`, taking into account, both the **attack mode** and **attack type**.
#
# The `effective_damage` function definition **must** invoke the `get_num_types` function you wrote during lab. Create a new cell in your Jupyter notebook above the definition of `effective_damage` and copy/paste the definition of `get_num_types` there. The Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points if you do not invoke `get_num_types`.
#
# Start with the code snippet provided below.
# -

# this function should return 0 if type1 is 'DNE', 1 if type1 is not 'DNE' but type2 is, and 2 if neither type is 'DNE'
# replace the '...' from the code below to complete the get_num_types function
def get_num_types(pkmn):
    if project.get_type1(pkmn) == "DNE":
        return 0
    elif project.get_type2(pkmn) == "DNE":
        return 1
    else:

# ### Function 4: `num_hits(attacker, defender)`
#
# Now that we have a way of calculating the damage done by the Pokemon during battle, we have to calculate **how many hits** each Pokemon can take before fainting.
#
# The number of hits a Pokemon can take is calculated by taking its **HP** and dividing it by the attacking Pokemon's **effective damage**.
#
# If the defending pokemon has `30 HP` and the attacking pokemon does `20` effective damage each turn, it will take `2` turns before the defender faints instead of `30 / 20 = 1.5`. You might want to use the method `math.ceil` here. First import the module `math` (remember to add the `import math` call at the **top of your notebook** in the cell where you have been asked to place all `import` statements) and then look up the documentation of `math.ceil` to see how you could use it.

#
# We need to update the `num_hits` function so that it can deal with cases like this. Go back and **modify** the `num_hits` function, so that when the `attacker` does an **effective damage** of `0.0` against the `defender`, then the function returns the **string** `'infinitely many'`. **Otherwise**, the function should compute and return the number of hits required by the `attacker` to make the `defender` faint (as it currently does).

# The function `battle` seems to be working well so far, but it does not quite follow all the rules that we laid out at the beginning.

However, when we look at the rules from above, we notice that the Pokemon with **higher speed attacks first**. This means that even if both Pokemon go down in the same number of hits, the Pokemon with the higher **Speed** stat will attack first, and will therefore land its last hit before the other Pokemon can hit back.
#
# In other words, if both Pokemon faint within the same number of moves, the Pokemon with the higher **speed** stat should win the battle.

# We are almost there now! There is one last feature still left to implement however. So far, we have been working under the assumption that both `pkmn1` and `pkmn2` can cause **non-zero** effective damage to each other. We will now deal with this case as well.
#
# Modify `battle` so that if one Pokemon can take **infintely many** hits from the other, then the Pokemon automatically wins. If **both** Pokemon can take **infinitely many** hits from **each other**, then the battle should be a `'Draw'`.
#
# **Hint:** Even though this is the *last* rule to implement, it is the *first* thing that the battle function should check. Also, here's another reminder to *not* redefine `battle`.

# ## Function 6: `friendship_score(pkmn1, pkmn2)`
#
# Pokemon aren't always violent. They are at most times quite friendly. However, some Pokemon are more friendly with some than they are with others. Trainers need to know which Pokemon get along well and which do not, to avoid unnecessary conflict between their Pokemon. Thankfully for trainers, there is an almost scientific way to determine how well two different Pokemon can get along with each other.
#
# Given two Pokemon `pkmn1` and `pkmn2`, we can compute the **friendship score** between them. A high friendship score (5) means the two Pokemon will get along really well, while a low friendship score (0) means they need to be kept far apart.
#
# We can check whether a pair of Pokemon has a high friendship score based on the below rules:
#
# 1. Pokemon from the **same region** gain a friendship point.
#
# 2. Pokemon gain a  friendship point if their **difference** in **stat total** is **at most** 20 points. The **stat total** of a Pokemon is the sum of its Attack, Defense, HP, Sp. Atk., Sp. Def., and Speed stats. 
#    
# 3. Pokemon gain a friendship point if they have the **same `type1`**.
#     
# 4. Pokemon gain a friendship point if they have the **same `type2`**, provided that this common `type2` is **not** `DNE`. This means that if the two Pokemon both have `DNE` as their common `type2`, then they will **not** receive any extra friendship points for it. 
#     
# 5. If a Pokemon's `type1` is the same as another Pokemon's `type2` (or vice versa), they do **not** gain any friendship points for it. They only gain points if the **corresponding** types are the same (and not `DNE`).
#     
# 6. Additionally, if the two Pokemon share **both** types in common (and their `type2` is **not** `DNE`), they get **another** point for synergy. For example, if two Pokemon have two types each, and both their corresponding types are the same, they will get a total of `3` points (2 for the common types and 1 for synergy).
#
#
# Define the function `friendship_score` that takes in two Pokemon as its arguments and returns their friendship score.
#
# **Hint:** You might want to use helper functions you wrote in Lab-P4 (remember to copy/paste them into this notebook before you try to use them).

# +
# this function should return the total hp + attack + defense + sp. atk. + sp. def. + speed stats of the given pkmn

    total = project.get_hp(pkmn) + project.get_attack(pkmn) + project.get_defense(pkmn) + project.get_sp_atk(pkmn) + project.get_sp_def(pkmn) + project.get_speed(pkmn)
    return total


# +

# if both Pokémon have the same total, this function should return 'Draw'
