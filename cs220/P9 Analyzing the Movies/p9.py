# # Project 9: Analyzing the Movies

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate your ability to:
# - use `matplotlib` to plot bar graphs and visualize statistics
# - process data using dictionaries and lists that you build
# - implement binning by writing algorithms that create dictionaries
# - custom sort a list using the keyword parameter `key`'s argument.
#
# Please go through [Lab-P9](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p9) before starting this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques necessary for this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `public_tests.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the value of the variable `expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.
#
# **Important:** `public_tests.py` **cannot** verify your answers when the output is an image. Your **plots** will be **checked** by the Gradescope autograder, so you must **manually** confirm that your plots look correct by comparing with the images provided in the notebook.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# <h2 style="color:red">Warning (Note on Academic Misconduct):</h2>
#
# **IMPORTANT**: **P8 and P9 are two parts of the same data analysis.** You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects. That is if you partnered up with someone for P8, you have to sustain that partnership until the end of P9. Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f23/syllabus.html).
#
# Under any circumstances, **no more than two students are allowed to work together on a project** as mentioned in the course policies. If your code is flagged by our code similarity detection tools, **both partners will be responsible** for sharing/copying the code, even if the code is shared/copied by one of the partners with/from other non-partner student(s). Note that each case of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students with a zero grade on the project. **If you think that someone cannot be your project partner then donâ€™t make that student your lab partner.**
#
# **<font color = "red">Project partners must submit only one copy of their project on Gradescope, but they must include the names of both partners.</font>**

# ## Introduction:
#
# In P8, you created very useful helper functions to parse the raw IMDb dataset. You also created useful data structures to store the data. In this project, you will be building on the work you did in P8 to analyze your favorite movies. This is a shorter project than usual, and **P9 will only have 10 questions for you to solve**.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Data:
#
# In P9, you will be analyzing the same dataset that you worked with in P8. You may download the files fresh, or just copy/paste the datasets from your P8 directory.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code, unless the question explicitly asks you to do so. If you open your `.csv` files with Excel, manually count through the rows and use this number to loop through the dataset, this is also considered as hardcoding. If any instances of hardcoding are found during code review, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Functions:
# - `bucketize`
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Data Structures:
# - `movies`
# - `cast_buckets`
# - `director_buckets`
# - `genre_buckets`
# - `year_buckets`
#
# You are only allowed to define these data structures **once** and we'll **deduct** points from your public score on Gradescope if you redefine the values of these variables.
#
# In this project (and the next), you will be asked to create **lists** of movies. For all such questions, **unless it is explicitly mentioned otherwise**, the movies should be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` (or `small_movies.csv`) file. Similarly, for each movie, the **list** of `genres`, `directors`, and `cast` members should always be in the **same order** as in the `movies.csv` (or `small_movies.csv`) file.
#
# Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P9. Therefore, you should not use the `pandas` module. The Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score otherwise.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p9/rubric.md).

The functions you should include are `process_csv`, `get_mapping`, `get_raw_movies`, and `get_movies` along with any helper functions you used to write these. Do **not** copy/paste `find_specific_movies` here. Later in P9, we will provide you with a simpler version of that function, which does not require the use of the `copy` module.

Making copies frequently is **not** a good coding practice. For this project, we will provide **a new version** of `find_specific_movies` that does **not** require using `copy`.

# ### Function 1: `bucketize(movies_list, category)` 
#
# This function should take in a **list** of movie **dictionaries** as well as a **category** (i.e. `title`, `year`, `duration`, `genres`, `rating`, `directors`, or `cast`), and *bucketize* the **list** of movie **dictionaries** by this **category**.
#
# For example, the output of `bucketize(movies, 'rating')` should be a **dictionary** so that all the unique values of `rating` of the movies in `movies` are the **keys** and the correspoding **values** would be a **list** of all movie **dictionaries** with that rating (e.g., the value of the key *6.4* should be the **list** of movie dictionaries with `rating` of *6.4*).
#
# The output of `bucketize(movies, 'rating')` should look like this:
#
# ```python
# {6.1: [{'title': 'A Grande Arte',
#         'year': 1991,
#         'duration': 104,
#         'genres': ['Drama', 'Thriller'],
#         'rating': 6.1,
#         'directors': ['Walter Salles'],
#         'cast': ['Peter Coyote', 'TchÃ©ky Karyo', 'Amanda Pays', 'Raul Cortez']},
#        {'title': 'Elena Undone',
#         'year': 2010,
#         'duration': 111,
#         'genres': ['Drama', 'Romance'],
#         'rating': 6.1,
#         'directors': ['Nicole Conn'],
#         'cast': ['Necar Zadegan', 'Thunderbird Dinwiddie', 'Gary Weeks', 'Sam Harris']},
#        ...
#       ],
#  4.1: [{'title': 'Enemy Gold',
#         'year': 1993,
#         'duration': 92,
#         'genres': ['Action', 'Crime'],
#         'rating': 4.1,
#         'directors': ['Christian Drew Sidaris'],
#         'cast': ['Bruce Penhall', 'Mark Barriere', 'Suzi Simpson', 'Tanquil Lisa Collins']},
#        {'title': "Dead Men Don't Die",
#         'year': 1990,
#         'duration': 94,
#         'genres': ['Comedy', 'Crime', 'Horror'],
#         'rating': 4.1,
#         'directors': ['Malcolm Marmorstein'],
#         'cast': ['Elliott Gould', 'Melissa Sue Anderson', 'Mark Moses', 'Mabel King']},
#        ...
#       ],
#  ...
# }
# ```
#
# Similarly, the output of `bucketize(movies, 'cast')` should be a **dictionary** so that all the unique `cast` members of the movies in `movies` are the **keys** and the correspoding **values** would be a **list** of all movie **dictionaries** with that cast member as one of their `cast` (e.g., the value of the key *Kate Winslet* should be the **list** of movie dictionaries with *Kate Winslet* as one of their `cast` members).
#
# The output of `bucketize(movies, 'cast')` should look like this:
#
# ```python
# {{'Peter Coyote': [{'title': 'A Grande Arte',
#                     'year': 1991,
#                     'duration': 104,
#                     'genres': ['Drama', 'Thriller'],
#                     'rating': 6.1,
#                     'directors': ['Walter Salles'],
#                     'cast': ['Peter Coyote', 'TchÃ©ky Karyo', 'Amanda Pays', 'Raul Cortez']},

#                   ],
#  'TchÃ©ky Karyo': [{'title': 'A Grande Arte',
#                    'year': 1991,

#  ...
# }

#
# **Hints:** Note that depending on whether or not the `category` represents a **list** or not, your function will have to behave differently. In P8, you created a function `bucketize_by_genre` that *bucketized* the list of movies by their genre. Take a moment to find that function; it will help you here. Also, take a moment to look at the buckets you made in Lab-P9.

# **Important:** Just like `get_movies`, `bucketize` is quite a time-consuming function to run. Hence, you do **not** want to call `bucketize` on the same list of movies and category **more than once**. Throughout the project, we will frequently use bucketized lists of movies organized by their `cast`, `directors`, `genre`, and `year`. Rather than calling `bucketize` several times, we will store the bucketized lists in the following variables:

# +
# define buckets for categories mentioned below, but do NOT display any of them

# bucketize the full list of movies by their cast.
cast_buckets = bucketize(movies, "cast")
# bucketize the full list of movies by their directors.

# bucketize the full list of movies by their genre.

# ### Finding the best `directors`
#
# Notice that the movie with the **highest** `rating` in the dataset is
#
# ```python
# {'title': 'Red Sandal Wood',
#   'year': 2023,
#   'duration': 94,
#   'genres': ['Action', 'Thriller'],
#   'rating': 9.9,
#   'directors': ['Guru Ramaanujam'],
#   'cast': ['Vetri', 'Diya Mayuri', 'Ramachandra Raju', 'Abhi']}
# ```
#
# This movie is the **only** movie directed by this `director`. So, it is hardly appropriate to use this one movie to hail this director as one of the best ever. Moreover, **nine out of the top ten** highest rated movies in the dataset happen to be from just the `year` **2023**, while **over half of the top hundred** highest rated movies were released after the `year` *2020*. This is explained by the fact that IMDb `ratings` tend to be **inflated** soon after release, and *settle* down after a while.
#
# Therefore, if we want to identify who the **best** directors are, it would be a good idea to ignore the movies that were released **after** the `year` *2020*, and to restrict our attention to `directors` who have directed a **decent number** of movies. 

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# **Question 10:** Produce a **list** of `directors` who have directed **at least** *10* movies, have a **median** `rating` of **at least** *7.5*, and have a **minimum** `rating` of **at least** *5.0*. You **must** **exclude** all movies released **after** the `year` *2020*.
#
# Your output **must** be a **list** of the names of the `directors`. The order does **not** matter.
#
# **Hint**: You must first create a **list** of movies **excluding** the movies released **after** the `year` *2020*. Then, among these movies, you must find the `directors` who have directed `>= 10` movies, and whose movies have a **median** `rating` of `>= 7.5`, as well as a **minimum** `rating` of `>= 5.0`.

# +
# compute and store the answer in the variable 'best_directors', then display it
