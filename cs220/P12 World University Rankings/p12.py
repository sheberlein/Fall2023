# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate your ability to
#
# * read and write files,
# * create and use `Pandas DataFrames`,
# * use `BeautifulSoup` to parse web pages.
#
# Please go through [Lab-P12](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p12) before working on this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# <h2 style="color:red">Warning (Note on Academic Misconduct):</h2>
#
# **IMPORTANT**: **P12 and P13 are two parts of the same data analysis.** You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects. That is if you partner up with someone for P12, you have to sustain that partnership until the end of P13. Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f23/syllabus.html).
#
# Under any circumstances, **no more than two students are allowed to work together on a project** as mentioned in the course policies. If your code is flagged by our code similarity detection tools, **both partners will be responsible** for sharing/copying the code, even if the code is shared/copied by one of the partners with/from other non-partner student(s). Note that each case of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students with a zero grade on the project. **If you think that someone cannot be your project partner then don’t make that student your lab partner.**
#
# **<font color = "red">Project partners must submit only one copy of their project on Gradescope, but they must include the names of both partners.</font>**

# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the files `public_tests.py` and `expected_dfs.html`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the output of the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.
#
# For answers involving DataFrames, `public_tests.py` compares your tables to those in `expected_dfs.html`, so take a moment to open that file on a web browser (from Finder/Explorer). `public_tests.py` doesn't care if you have extra rows or columns, and it doesn't care about the order of the rows or columns. However, you must have the correct values at each index/column location shown in `expected_dfs.html`.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Introduction:
#
# For this project, you're going to analyze World University Rankings!
#
# Specifically, you're going to use Pandas to analyze various statistics of the top ranked universities across the world, over the last three years.
#
# Start by downloading the files `public_tests.py`, and `expected_dfs.html`.
#
# **Important Warning:** Do **not** download any of the other `json` or `html` files manually (you **must** write Python code to download these automatically, as in Lab-P12). When we run the autograder, the other files such as `rankings.json`, `2021.html`, `2022.html`, `2023.html` will **not** be in the directory. So, unless your `p12.ipynb` downloads these files, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score. More details can be found in the **Setup** section of the project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Data:
#
# For this project, we will be analyzing statistics about world university rankings adapted from [here](https://cwur.org/). These are the specific webpages that we extracted the data from:
#
# * https://cwur.org/2020-21.php
# * https://cwur.org/2021-22.php
# * https://cwur.org/2023.php
#
# Later in the project, you will be scraping these webpages and extracting the data yourself. Since we don't want all of you bombarding these webpages with requests, we have made snapshots of these webpages, and hosted them on GitLab. You can find the snapshots here:
#
# * https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/p12/2021.html
# * https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/p12/2022.html
# * https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/p12/2023.html
#
# We have also tweaked the snapshots a little, to streamline the process of data extraction for you. You will be extracting the data from these three html pages and analyzing them. However, to make the start of the project a little easier, we have already parsed the files for you! We have gathered the data from these html files, and collected them in a single json file, which can be found here:
#
# * https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/raw/main/p12/rankings.json
#
# You will work with this json file for most of this project. At the end of this project, you will generate an identical json file by parsing the html files yourself.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code. You **may not** manually download **any** files for this project, unless you are **explicitly** told to do so. For all other files, you **must** use the `download` function to download the files.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Functions:
# - `download`
# - `parse_html`
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Data Structures:
# - `rankings`
# - `year_2021_ranking_df`
# - `year_2022_ranking_df`
# - `year_2023_ranking_df`
# - `institutions_df`
#
# In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:
# * **Avoid using loops to iterate over pandas dataframes and instead use boolean indexing.**
# * Do **not** use `loc` to look up data in **DataFrames** or **Series**, unless you are explicitly told to do so. You are **allowed** to use `iloc`.
# * Do **not** use **absolute** paths such as `C://mdoescher//cs220//p12`. You may **only** use **relative paths**.
# * Do **not** leave irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.
# * **Avoid** calling **slow** functions multiple times within a loop.
# * Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p12/rubric.md).

# **Question 16:** **List** the universities which ranked in the **top** 50 of world rankings (`World Rank`) in the `Year` *2021* but **failed** to do so in the `Year` *2023*.
#
# Your output **must** be a **list** of institutions. The **order** does **not** matter. You **must** use the `year_2021_ranking_df` and `year_2023_ranking_df` DataFrames that you created in Question 11 to answer this question.
#
# **Hints:**
# 1. There could be institutions that are ranked in the **top** 50 in *2021* but do not feature in *2023* at all; you still want to include them in your list.
# 2. You can use `sort_values` and `iloc` to identify the **top** 50 institutions.
# 3. Given two *sets* `A` and `B`, you can find the elements which are in `A` but not in `B` using `A - B`. For example,
# ```python
# set_A = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
# set_B = {20, 40, 70}
# set_A - set_B == {10, 30, 50} # elements which are in set_A but not in set_B

# **Question 17:** **List** the countries which have **at least** *5* and **at most** *10* institutions featuring in the **top** *100* of world rankings (`World Rank`) in the `Year` *2023*.
#
# Your output **must** be a **list**.
#
# **Hints:**
#
# 1. In a **DataFrame**, to find the **number** of times each unique value in a column repeats, you can use the `DataFrame.value_counts` method. For example,
# ``` python
# rankings["Country"].value_counts()
# ```
# would output a `pandas` **Series** with the **indices** being the unique values of `Country` and the **values** being the **number** of times each country has featured in the `rankings` **DataFrame**. You can find the documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.value_counts.html) or by using the `help` function in a separate cell. You can adapt this code to find the number of institutions from each country that features in the `Year` *2023*.
# 2. Just like with **DataFrames**, you can use Boolean indexing on **Series**. For example, try something like this in a separate cell below:
# ```python
# a = pd.Series([100, 200, 300])
# a[a > 100]
# ```
# 3. You can extract the **indices** of a **Series**, `s` with `s.index`.

# ## Beautiful Soup

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Setup
#
# In real life, you don't often have data in nice JSON format like `rankings.json`. Instead, data needs to be *scraped* from multiple webpages and requires some cleanup before it can be used.
#
# Most of the projects in CS220 have used data obtained via web scraping, including this one. For p12, as explained above, we obtained the data by scraping the following websites:
#
# * https://cwur.org/2020-21.php
# * https://cwur.org/2021-22.php
# * https://cwur.org/2023.php
#
# Our `rankings.json` file was created using data from these webpages. For the rest of this project, you will write the code to **recreate** `rankings.json` file from the tables in these html pages yourself! We also do **not** want all students in this class to be making multiple requests to the webpages above, as that could be very costly for the people managing the webpages. Instead, we have made **copies** of the webpages above, which can be found here:
#

# * https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/raw/main/p12/2023.html
#
# Before you can parse these html files, you must first *download* them. You **must** use your `download` function to download these files.

# **Question 18:** Use `BeautifulSoup` to **parse** `2021.html`, and find the **table** containing the ranking data. Extract the **column names** of this table and the first row of the table to create a **dictionary** where the column headers are the keys and the corresponding values are extracted from the **first** row.
#
# You do **not** have to perform any typecasting of the data **yet**. Your output **must** be a **dictionary** having the format as given below:
# ```python

#     'Faculty Rank': '1',
#     'Research Rank': '1',
#     'Score': '100'

# ### Function 2: `parse_html(filename)`
#
# You **must** write this function which takes in a HTML file `filename` as its input, parses it, and returns a **list** of **dictionaries** containing all the data in the **table** stored in `filename`.
#
# Note that the data in all these files is **not** stored in the same format. In particular, the `World Rank` column in `2023.html` contains some additional data that we do not need for this dataset. Similarly, the `Institution` column in `2022.html` and `2023.html` contains some additional data for the first twelve rows that we do not need. Your function **must** deal with all these different cases, and return a **dictionary** in the same format as below.
#
# There are **no** restrictions on **hardcoding** for this function. You may tailor your function to work for only these three html files. However, this same function **must** work on **all three** of these html files.
#
# For example, the output of the function call `parse_html("2023.html")` **must** look like this:
#
# ```python
# [
#     {'Year': 2023,
#       'World Rank': 1,
#       'Institution': 'Harvard University',
#       'Country': 'USA',
#       'National Rank': 1,
#       'Education Rank': 1,
#       'Employability Rank': 1,
#       'Faculty Rank': 1,
#       'Research Rank': 1,
#       'Score': 100.0},
#      {'Year': 2023,
#       'World Rank': 2,
#       'Institution': 'Massachusetts Institute of Technology',
#       'Country': 'USA',
#       'National Rank': 2,
#       'Education Rank': 4,
