#  # Project 13: World University Rankings

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate how to:
#
# * query a database using SQL,
# * process data using `pandas` **DataFrames**,
# * create different types of plots.
#
# Please go through [Lab-P13](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p13) before working on this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# <h2 style="color:red">Warning (Note on Academic Misconduct):</h2>
#
# **IMPORTANT**: **P12 and P13 are two parts of the same data analysis.** You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects. That is if you partnered up with someone for P12, you have to sustain that partnership until the end of P13.
#
# **You are  not allowed to use any late days for P13, even if you have late days remaining in your late days bank.** Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f23/syllabus.html).
#
# Under any circumstances, **no more than two students are allowed to work together on a project** as mentioned in the course policies. If your code is flagged by our code similarity detection tools, **both partners will be responsible** for sharing/copying the code, even if the code is shared/copied by one of the partners with/from other non-partner student(s). Note that each case of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students with a zero grade on the project. **If you think that someone cannot be your project partner then donâ€™t make that student your lab partner.**
#
# **<font color = "red">Project partners must submit only one copy of their project on Gradescope, but they must include the names of both partners.</font>**

# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the files `public_tests.py` and `expected_dfs.html`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the output of the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.
#
# For answers involving DataFrames, `public_tests.py` compares your tables to those in `expected_dfs.html`, so take a moment to open that file on a web browser (from Finder/Explorer). `public_tests.py` doesn't care if you have extra rows or columns, and it doesn't care about the order of the rows or columns. However, you must have the correct values at each index/column location shown in `expected_dfs.html`.
#
# **IMPORTANT Warning:** Do **not** download the dataset `rankings.json` **manually**. Use the `download` function from P12 to download it. When we run the autograder, this file `rankings.json` will **not** be in the directory. So, unless your `p13.ipynb` downloads these files, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Description:
#
# For your final CS220 project, you're going to continue analyzing world university rankings. However, we will be using a different dataset this time. The data for this project has been extracted from [here](https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings). Unlike the CWUR rankings we used in P12, the QS rankings dataset has various scores for the universities, and not just the rankings. This makes the QS rankings dataset more suitable for plotting (which you will be doing a lot of!).
#
# In this project, you'll have to dump your DataFrame to a SQLite database. You'll answer questions by doing queries on that database. Often, your answers will be in the form of a plot. Check these carefully, as the tests only verify that a plot has been created, not that it looks correct (the Gradescope autograder will manually deduct points for plotting mistakes).

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code. You **may not** manually download **any** files for this project, unless you are **explicitly** told to do so. For all other files, you **must** use the `download` function to download the files.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Functions:
# - `download`
# - `bar_plot`
# - `scatter_plot`
# - `horizontal_bar_plot`
# - `pie_plot`
# - `get_regression_coeff`
# - `get_regression_line`
# - `regression_line_plot`
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, we'll **manually deduct** points from your autograder score on Gradescope, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Data Structures:
# - `conn`
#
# You **must** write SQL queries to solve the questions in this project, unless you are **explicitly** told otherwise. You will **not get any credit** if you use `pandas` operations to extract data. We will give you **specific** instructions for any questions where `pandas` operations are allowed. In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:
#
# * You **must** close the connection to `conn` at the end of your notebook.
# * Do **not** use **absolute** paths such as `C://mdoescher//cs220//p13`. You may **only** use **relative paths**.
# * Do **not** hardcode `//` or `\` in any of your paths. You **must** use `os.path.join` to create paths.
# * Do **not** leave irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.
# * **Avoid** calling **slow** functions multiple times within a loop.
# * Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p13/rubric.md).

# **Question 20:** Using the data from Question 5, create a **pie plot** representing the number of institutions from each country.
#
# You **have** already computed a **DataFrame** `num_institutions` (in Question 5) containing the **Country**, and the **Number of Insititutions** data. Run the following cell just to confirm that the variable has not changed its values since you defined it in Question 5.

# Now, **plot** `num_institutions` as **pie plot** with the **title** *Number of Institutions*.
#
# You **must** use the `pie_plot` function to create the **pie plot**. The **colors** do **not** matter, but the plot **must** be titled `Number of Institutions`, and **must** be labelled as in the sample output below.
#
# **Important Warning:** `public_tests.py` can check that the **DataFrame** is correct, but it **cannot** check if your plot appears on the screen, or whether the axes are correctly labelled. If your plot is not visible, or if it is not properly labelled, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct points**.
#
# Your plot should look like this:
# -

# create the pie plot using the DataFrame 'num_institutions' titled "Number of Institutions"
pie_plot(num_institutions, "Country", "Number of Institutions", title="Number of Institutions")

# ### Closing the database connection:
#
# Now, before you **submit** your notebook, you **must** **close** your connection `conn`. Not doing this might make **Gradescope fail**. Additionally, **delete** the example images provided with plot questions to save space, if your notebook file is too large for submission. You can **delete** any cell by selecting the cell, hitting the `Esc` key once, and then hitting the `d` key **twice**.

# ## Submission
# It is recommended that at this stage, you Restart and Run all Cells in your notebook.
# That will automatically save your work and generate a zip file for you to submit.
#
# **SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS**:
# 1. **Upload** the zipfile to Gradescope.
# 2. If you completed the project with a **partner**, make sure to **add their name** by clicking "Add Group Member"
# in Gradescope when uploading the zip file.
# 3. Check **Gradescope** results as soon as the auto-grader execution gets completed.
# 4. Your **final score** for this project is the score that you see on **Gradescope**.
# 5. You are **allowed** to resubmit on Gradescope as many times as you want to.
# 6. **Contact** a TA/PM if you lose any points on Gradescope for any **unclear reasons**.
