# ## Project Description:
#
# In this project, we will analyze data in [`soccer_stars.csv`](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p7/soccer_stars.csv). This dataset has some data on nearly 20,000 soccer stars who play in the top soccer leagues across the world. The statistics in this dataset are obained from the video game [FC'24](https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-24) (formerly the FIFA series) and was collected from the website [https://sofifa.com/](https://sofifa.com/). We will look at various statistics about your favorite players and teams, and identify their strengths and weaknesses.

# The dataset contains the following information about each player:
# - `ID` : the **unique ID** used by FC'24 for identifying each player,
# - `Name` : the **name** of the player,
# - `Age` : the **age** of the player,
# - `Nationality` : the **national team** the player represents,
# - `Team` : the **football club** that the player represents,
# - `League`: the **football league** that the player's club is a part of,
# - `Value` : the **value** of the player in the transfer market (in **Euros**),
# - `Wage` : the **weekly wages** earned by the player as per their contract (in **Euros**),
# - `Attacking` : the **total attacking stats** of the player (out of **100.0**),
# - `Movement` : the **total movement stats** of the player (out of **100.0**),
# - `Defending` : the **total defending stats** of the player (out of **100.0**),
# - `Goalkeeping` : the **total goalkeeping stats** of the player (out of **100.0**),
# - `Overall rating` : the **overall rating** of the player (out of **100**),
# - `Position` : the player's **favored position** on the soccer field,
# - `Height` : the **height** of the player (in **centimeters**),
# - `Preferred foot` : the player's **favored foot**.
#
# **Please go through [Lab-P7](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p7) before starting this project.** The lab introduces some useful techniques necessary for parsing the dataset and for answering questions in this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code unless specified in the question. If you are not sure what hardcoding is, here is a simple test you can use to determine whether you have hardcoded:
#
# *If we were to change the data (e.g. add more soccer players, remove some players, change their statistics, or swap some columns or rows), would your code still find the correct answer to the question as it is asked?*
#
# If your answer to that question is *No*, then you have likely hardcoded something. Please reach out to TAs/PMs during office hours to find out how you can **avoid hardcoding**.
#
# In general, all your functions and code must be **case sensitive** unless the function or question description **explicitly** says otherwise.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer.  If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Functions:
#
# - `format_euros`
# - `cell`
# - `average_stat_by_position`
# - `best_player_of_team_at_position`
# - `best_starting_players_of`
#
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Data Structures:
#
# - `players` 
#     
# Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P7. Therefore, **you should not use the pandas module**. The Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points otherwise.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p7/rubric.md).

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Incremental Coding and Testing:
#
# You should always strive to do incremental coding. **Incremental coding enables you to avoid challenging bugs.** Always write a few lines of code and then test those lines of code, before proceeding to write further code. You can call the `print` function to test intermediate step outputs.
#
# We also recommend you do incremental testing: make sure to run the local tests as soon as you are done with a question. This will ensure that you haven't made a big mistake that might potentially impact the rest of your project solution. Please refrain from making multiple submissions on Gradescope for testing individual questions' answers. Instead use the local tests, to test your solution on your laptop.
#
# That said, it is **important** that you check the Gradescope test results as soon as you submit your project on Gradescope. Test results on Gradescope are typically available somewhere between 15 to 30 minutes after the submission.
#
# Also, remember to check with the [P7 rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p7/rubric.md) to verify that you will not be losing any points during manual review.

# First, read the data stored in `soccer_stars.csv`. You **must** read the csv file and then get the header and rows (and store them into `csv_header` and `csv_rows` variables). You will **lose points** if you use any other names to store these variables.
#
# **Note**: It is recommended that you just copy/paste the code from your Lab-P7 notebook. However, instead of reading data from `small_soccer_stars.csv`, this time, you **must** read the data from `soccer_stars.csv`.
# -

# We will now copy/paste some function and data structure definitions from Lab-P7 to get us started with the project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Function 1: `format_euros(euros)` 
#
# You **must** write a helper function that takes in a **string** representing the `Wage` or `Value` (such as `"€250K"` or `"€158.5M"`), and converts it into an **int**.
#
# For example, `"€250K"` should be converted to `250000`, and `"€158.5M"` should be converted to `158500000`.
#
# You can **assume** that the first character of the input string `euros` always starts with the Euro symbol (€), and that **if** the last character is either `"K"` or `"M"`, it represents the preceeding number in thousands or millions, respectively. Note that the last character **need not** be `"K"` or `"M"` in all inputs. If the last character is not one of these letters, then the entire input string (except the starting €) can be **assumed** to be an **integer**.
#
# **Note:** You may copy/paste your definition of `format_euros` from Lab-P7 here.

    elif (euros[-1] == "M"):
        euros = float(euros[0:-1]) * 1000000
    else:
        euros = float(euros)
    return int(euros)


# + deletable=false editable=false
grader.check("format_euros")


# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Function 2: `cell(row_idx, col_name)` 
#
# This function must take in a row index, `row_idx` and a column name, `col_name` as its inputs, and return the value in `soccer_stars.csv` stored there. There is **no missing data** in this dataset, so you do **not** have to worry about returning `None` for **missing data**.
#
# Your `cell` function **must** also typecast the values based on column names. These are the expected data types for each of the columns:
#
# - `ID` : **int**,
# - `Name` : **str**,
# - `Age` : **int**,
# - `Nationality` : **str**,
# - `Team` : **str**,
# - `League` : **str**,
# - `Value` : **int**,
# - `Wage` : **int**,
# - `Attacking` : **float**,
# - `Movement` : **float**,
# - `Defending` : **float**,
# - `Goalkeeping` : **float**,
# - `Overall rating` : **int**,
# - `Position` : **str**,
# - `Height` : **int**,
# - `Preferred foot` : **str**.
#
# Make special care to convert the `Height` into an **int** by slicing off the units, and to convert the `Wage` and `Value` into **ints** using the `format_euros` helper function.
#
# **Note:** You may copy/paste your definition of `cell` from Lab-P7 here. Since the variables `csv_header` and `csv_rows` are defined in this notebook to be data in `soccer_stars.csv`, the same function from Lab-P7 will now read the data from `soccer_stars.csv` instead of `small_soccer_stars.csv`.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ### Data Structure 1: `players` 
#
# You **must** now define a data structure `players` that stores all the data in `soccer_stars.csv` after processing the values. This data structure **must** be a **dictionary** of **dictionaries**. The **outer dictionary** must map each player `ID` to another **dictionary** which contains all the data about the player with that `ID`. Each **inner dictionary** corresponding to each player must map the **column names** to their **values** for that player.
#
# #### For the rest of the project, you MUST access data from `soccer_stars.csv` ONLY using this data structure `players`.
#
# The first few elements of `players` **must** look like this:
#
# ```python

# ### Soccer Positions
#
# We will now analyze the various **positions** on the soccer field. Before we get started, it will be helpful to have at least a rough idea as to what the different **positions** are. Here is an image that explains where each **position** is expected to play on the soccer field:
# -

# <div><img src="attachment:positions.jpg" style="height: 400px;"/></div>

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# The **bottom** of the image is the team's goalpost, and the **top** is the opposite team's goalpost. The positions closer to the **bottom** of the image are broadly tasked with **protecting** their team's goal, while the positions closer to the **top** of the image are tasked with **scoring** goals against the opposition.
#
# Apart from the *Goalkeeper* (**GK**), the **five** players closest to their own goalpost (**LWB**, **LB**, **CB**, **RB**, **RWB**) are called *Defenders*. The **five** players in the middle of the field (**CDM**, **LM**, **CM**, **RM**, **CAM**) are called *Midfielders*, and the **four** players closest to the oppposite team's goalpost (**LW**, **CF**, **RW**, **ST**) are called the *Forwards*.
#
# With this brief explanation, you are ready to tackle more questions in this project!

# ### Forming Teams
#
# For the rest of this project, we will attempt to construct **teams** for the various teams in our dataset.
#
# To start with, it would be useful to identify the **best** player at any given `Position` for a `Team`. We could get more fancy here, by using a stat such as `Defending`, or perhaps a combination of stats such as `Defending`, `Movement`, and `Height` to identify the **best** *CB*, and use stats such as `Attacking` to identify the **best** *CF*.
#
# However, we will keep it **simple** here, and just use the `Overall rating` to determine the **best** players.

# ### Function 4: `best_player_of_team_at_position(position, team)`

# This function must take in a `position` as well as a `team` and then return the `ID` of the player who plays for the given `team`, and has the **highest** `Overall rating` among **all other players** who play at that `position` for the same `team`.
#
# In case two players are **tied** with the **same** `Overall rating`, the ties **must** be broken in favor of the player with the **smaller** `ID`.
#
# In case there are **no** players who play at the given `position` for the given `team`, then the function **must** return `None`.
#
# **Note**: It is important to find the `ID` of the best player, and **not** something like their `Name`. This is because if we have the `ID`, we can then use the `players` **dict** to extract **all** statistics about the player.

#

#
# There are a few problems with this approach. For a start, *most* teams will **not** have players for **each** `Position`. For example, a team which uses a *Striker* (**ST**) might not need a *Center Forward* (**CF**) as well. Alternately, a team might play **two** *Center Midfielders* (**CM**) and **not** use any *Right Midfielders* (**RM**) or *Left Midfielders* (**LM**) at all.
#
# For now, we will not deal with these complexities. We will simply pick the **best** player for **each** `Position`, to form a team. We also won't concern ourselves with **how many** players are picked in total.

# In the case where two players are **tied** with the **same** `Overall rating`, the ties **must** be broken in favor of the player with the **smaller** `ID`.
