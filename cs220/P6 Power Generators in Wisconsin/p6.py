# # Project 6: Power Generators in Wisconsin

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate how to:
#
# * access and utilize data in CSV files,
# * process real world datasets,
# * use string methods and sorting function / method to order data.
#
# Please go through [Lab-P6](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p6) before working on this project. The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `public_tests.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Description:
#
# In this project, we will use Python to analyze Electric Power Generation within the state of Wisconsin. The data used in this project has been adapted from [this dataset](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/data/eia860m/) maintained by the **US Energy Information Administration**. `power_generators.csv` has data of all 613 power generators within the state of Wisconsin that were in operation as of August 2023. This file includes information about the capacities, locations, and the technologies used by the generators.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Dataset:
#
# A small portion of the dataset `power_generators.csv` you will be working with for this project is reproduced here:

# Each row of data represents a **single** generator. The columns contain the following data about each generator (along with the correct data type you **must** represent it as):
#
# 1. `entity_id` - the **ID** of the **entity** that operates the Power Generator (`int`)
# 2. `entity_name` - the **name** of the **entity** that operates the Power Generator (`str`)
# 3. `plant_id` - the **ID** of the **Power Plant** hosting the Power Generator (`int`)
# 4. `plant_name` - the **name** of the **Power Plant** hosting the Power Generator (`str`)
# 5. `generator_id` - the **ID** of the specific **Power Generator** within its Power Plant (`str`)
# 6. `county` - the **name** of the **county** that the **Power Plant** is located in (`str`)
# 7. `net_summer_capacity` - the maximum **capacity** of the **Power Generator** (in units of MW) during the Summer months (`float`)
# 8. `net_winter_capacity` - the maximum **capacity** of the **Power Generator** (in units of MW) during the Winter months (`float`)
# 9. `technology` - the **technology** used by the **Power Generator** (`str`)
# 10. `latitude` - the **latitude** where the **Power Plant** is located (`float`)
# 11. `longitude` - the **longitude** where the **Power Plant** is located (`float`)
#
# You can find more details on the dataset in [Lab-P6](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p6).

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code unless specified in the question. If you are not sure what hardcoding is, here is a simple test you can use to determine whether you have hardcoded:
#
# *If we were to change the data (e.g. add more power generators, remove some power generators, or swap some columns or rows), would your code still find the correct answer to the question as it is asked?*
#
# If your answer to that question is *No*, then you have likely hardcoded something. Please reach out to TAs/PMs during office hours to find out how you can **avoid hardcoding**.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer.  If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Functions:
# - `process_csv`
# - `cell`
# - `find_entities_with_phrase`
# - `num_generators_by`
# - `find_indices_within`
# - `median`
# - `total_summer_capacity_of`
# - `avg_winter_capacity_of`
#     
# Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P6. Therefore, **you should not use concepts/modules such as dictionaries, or the pandas module, to name a few examples**. Otherwise, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p6/rubric.md).
