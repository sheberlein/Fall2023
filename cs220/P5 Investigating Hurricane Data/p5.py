# # Project 5: Investigating Hurricane Data

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project you will demonstrate how to:
# - write fundamental loop structures,
# - perform basic string manipulations,
# - create your own helper functions as outlined in Lab-P5.
#
# **Please go through [Lab-P5](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p5) before working on this project.** The lab introduces some useful techniques related to this project.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the file `public_tests.py`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Description:
#
# Hurricanes often count among the worst natural disasters, both in terms of monetary costs, and more importantly, human life. Data Science can help us better understand these storms. For example, take a quick look at this FiveThirtyEight analysis by Maggie Koerth-Baker: [Why We're Stuck With An Inadequate Hurricane Rating System](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-stuck-with-an-inadequate-hurricane-rating-system/)
#
# For this project, you'll be analyzing data in the `hurricanes.csv` file. We generated this data file by writing a Python program to extract data from several lists of hurricanes over the Atlantic Ocean on Wikipedia (here is an [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Atlantic_hurricane_season)). You can take a look at the script `gen_csv.ipynb` yourself. At the end of the semester, you will be able to write it yourself. 
#
# We won't explain how to use the `project` module here (the code in the `project.py` file). Refer to [Lab-P5](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p5) to understand how the module works. If necessary, use the `help` function to learn about the various functions inside `project.py`. Feel free to take a look at the `project.py` code, if you are curious about how it works.
#
# This project consists of writing code to answer 20 questions.

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Dataset:
#
# The dataset you will be working with in this project is linked [here](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/p5/hurricanes.csv). Be sure to look at this csv to see what it contains, and specifically what the names of the columns are.
#
# If needed, you can open the `hurricanes.csv` file, to verify answers to simple questions, but you must still have the correct code in your submission!

# + [markdown] deletable=false editable=false
# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code unless specified in the question. If you hardcode the value of `project.count()`, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points. If you are not sure what hardcoding is, here is a simple test you can use to determine whether you have hardcoded:
#
# *If we were to change the data (e.g. add more hurricanes, remove some hurricanes, or swap some columns or rows), would your code still find the correct answer to the question as it is asked?*
#
# If your answer to that question is *No*, then you have likely hardcoded something. Please reach out to TAs/PMs during office hours to find out how you can **avoid hardcoding**.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer.  If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# Required Functions:
# - `get_month`
# - `get_day`
# - `get_year`
# - `format_damage`
# - `deadliest_in_range`
# - `get_year_total`
#     
# Students are only allowed to use Python commands and concepts that have been taught in the course prior to the release of P5. Therefore, **you should not use concepts/modules such as lists, dictionaries, or the pandas module, to name a few examples**. Otherwise, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p5/rubric.md).

# ## Incremental Coding and Testing:
#
# You should always strive to do incremental coding. Incremental coding enables you to avoid challenging bugs. Always write a few lines of code and then test those lines of code, before proceeding to write further code. You can call the `print` function to test intermediate step outputs.
#
# We also recommend you do incremental testing: make sure to run the local tests as soon as you are done with a question. This will ensure that you haven't made a big mistake that might potentially impact the rest of your project solution. Please refrain from making multiple submissions on Gradescope for testing individual questions' answers. Instead use the local tests, to test your solution on your laptop.
#
# That said, it is **important** that you check the Gradescope test results as soon as you submit your project on Gradescope. Test results on Gradescope are typically available somewhere between 10 to 20 minutes after the submission.

# ## Project Questions and Functions:
# -

# it is considered a good coding practice to place all import statements at the top of the notebook
# please place all your import statements in this cell if you need to import any more modules for this project
import project

# For the first three questions, you do not have to define any of your own functions. Use the `project` module by calling the specific function needed to solve a certain question.
#
# *Please Note*, indexing in python starts from **0**. Therefore, if a question asks you to use a certain value's **index**, do not be confused that with the **location** of the value in the dataset. In our dataset here,
#
# ![table.PNG](attachment:table.PNG)
#
# the **index** for `1804 New England Hurricane` is 0, but the **location** is 1, and the **row number** is 2. Be sure to keep this concept in mind for *all* questions asking for the value at a particular **index**.

# ### Function 1: `format_damage(damage)`
#
# You will notice if you look at the dataset that the damages caused by the hurricanes are not stored directly as numbers. Instead the damages have a suffix (`"K"`, `"M"`, or `"B"`) attached at the very end. You will have to convert these 'numbers' into integers before you can perform any mathematical operations on them. 
#
# Since you will need to format damages for multiple hurricanes, you **must** create a general helper function that handles the `"K"`, `"M"`, and `"B"` suffixes. Remember that `"K"` stands for thousand, `"M"` stands for million, and `"B"` stands for billion. For example, your function should convert the string `"13.5M"` to `13500000`, `"6.9K"` to `6900` and so on. Note that for **some** hurricanes, the `damage` does **not** have **any** suffixes. For instance, the hurricane `Florence` at index `308` did damage `'0'`. Your function **must** also deal with such inputs, by directly typecasting them to ints. 
#
# This function should take in the strings from the `damage` column as input, and return an **int**. Refer to Task 3.2 in Lab-P5 to understand how to slice and calculate damage.
#
# **Warning:** Your function `format_damage` must take in the damage as a **string**, and **not** an index. If you code your function to take in the index of a hurricane, and return the damage caused as an int, it will be useful only for this project. To make your function more useful, you must make it accept the damage itself (i.e., a string like `"13.5M"` or `"6.9K"`) as input.

# **Question 19:** How **many** hurricanes lasted across at least 2 *different* `months`?
#
# **Hint:** You can determine if a hurricane lasted across two different months by comparing the month of formation and the month of dissipation of the hurricane. Note that there may be hurricanes which formed late in the year, and dissipated early in the next year. You may make the assumption that **no** hurricane formed in one month, lasted years, and then dissipated in the same month of a different year.

# **Question 20:** What is the **average** `damage` caused by the **deadliest** hurricane of each year from *2001 - 2023*, both inclusive?
#
# You **must** use the `deadliest_in_range` function to identify the deadliest hurricane of each year, and you **must** use `format_damage` to convert the `damages` into an `int`. If two hurricanes in a year have the **same** deaths, you must break ties in favor of the hurricane that appears **first** in the dataset.
#
# **Hint:** For calculating average only consider the years that had a deadliest hurricane. If a particular year has no hurricanes in it (which would imply that it has no deadliest hurricane), you should skip that year from both the numerator and the denominator.
#
# Your answer **must** be a  **float**.
