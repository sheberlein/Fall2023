# # Project 11: Analyzing Stars and Planets

# # Learning Objectives:
#
# In this project, you will demonstrate how to:
#     
# * analyze the data from P10,
# * make scatter plots using `matplotlib`,
# * remove outliers to make the plots more useful,
# * use recursion to gather new data.
#
# **Please go through [Lab-P11](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/tree/main/lab-p11) before working on this project.** The lab introduces some important techniques related to this project.

# <h2 style="color:red">Warning (Note on Academic Misconduct):</h2>
#
# **IMPORTANT**: **P10 and P11 are two parts of the same data analysis.** You **cannot** switch project partners between these two projects. That is if you partnered up with someone for P10, you have to sustain that partnership until the end of P11. Now may be a good time to review [our course policies](https://cs220.cs.wisc.edu/f23/syllabus.html).
#
# Under any circumstances, **no more than two students are allowed to work together on a project** as mentioned in the course policies. If your code is flagged by our code similarity detection tools, **both partners will be responsible** for sharing/copying the code, even if the code is shared/copied by one of the partners with/from other non-partner student(s). Note that each case of plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students with a zero grade on the project. **If you think that someone cannot be your project partner then don’t make that student your lab partner.**
#
# **<font color = "red">Project partners must submit only one copy of their project on Gradescope, but they must include the names of both partners.</font>**

# ## Testing your code:
#
# Along with this notebook, you must have downloaded the files `public_tests.py` and `expected_plots.json`. If you are curious about how we test your code, you can explore this file, and specifically the output of the function `get_expected_json`, to understand the expected answers to the questions.
#
# **Important:** `public_tests.py` **cannot** verify your answers when the output is an image. Your **plots** will be **checked** by the Gradescope autograder, so you must **manually** confirm that your plots look correct by comparing with the images provided in the notebook.

# ## Setup:
#
# In P11, you will be analyzing the same dataset that you parsed in P10. You can either copy/paste the `data` directory to your P11 directory, or download the `data.zip` file provided with this project, and extract it. In addition to the `data` directory, you will also need to download additional datasets for P11. You must download `broken_data.zip` and extract it. You must extract the contents of the directory `broken_data` into the same directory which contains the `data` directory, `p11.ipynb`, `public_tests.py`, and `expected_plots.json`.
#
# You need to make sure that the project files are stored in the following structure:

#
# Make sure that **all** files are stored in this **exact** file structure. Otherwise, then there is a possibility that your code will **fail on Gradescope** even after passing local tests.

# ## Project Description:
#
# You have already parsed the data in the `data` directory in P10. You will now dive deeper by analyzing this data and arrive at some exciting conclusions about various planets and stars outside our Solar System. You will also use recursion to retrieve data from the broken JSON file in the `data` directory, and ask some interesting questions about the data.

# ## Project Requirements:
#
# You **may not** hardcode indices in your code, unless the question explicitly says so. If you open your `.csv` files with Excel, manually count through the rows and use this number to loop through the dataset, this is also considered as hardcoding. If any instances of hardcoding are found during code review, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.
#
# **Store** your final answer for each question in the **variable specified for each question**. This step is important because Otter grades your work by comparing the value of this variable against the correct answer.
#
# For some of the questions, we'll ask you to write (then use) a function to compute the answer. If you compute the answer **without** creating the function we ask you to write, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public test score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Functions:
# - `star_cell`
# - `get_stars`
# - `planet_cell`
# - `get_planets`
# - `plot_scatter`
# - `plot_scatter_multiple`
# - `get_all_paths_in`
# - `get_surface_gravity`
# - `get_distances_to_star`
# - `get_liquid_water_distances`
# - `get_surface_temperatures`
#
# In this project, you will also be required to define certain **data structures**. If you do not create these data structures exactly as specified, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public test score, even if the way you did it produced the correct answer.
#
# #### Required Data Structures:
# - `Star` (**namedtuple**)
# - `stars_dict` (**dictionary** mapping **strings** to `Star` objects)
# - `Planet` (**namedtuple**)
# - `planets_list` (**list** of `Planet` objects)
# - `star_classes` (**dictionary**)
# - `all_planets_list` (**list** of `Planet` objects)
#
# In addition, you are also **required** to follow the requirements below:
#
# * You **must** never use the output of the `os.listdir` function directly. You **must** always first remove all files and directories that start with `"."`, and **explicitly sort** the list before doing anything with it.
# * You are **not** allowed to use **modules** like `pandas` to answer the questions in this project.
# * You **must** properly **label** the axes of all your **plots**.
# * Do **not** define multiple functions with the same name or define multiple versions of one function with different names. Just keep the best version.
# * Do **not** leave in irrelevant output or test code that we didn't ask for.
#
# Otherwise, the Gradescope autograder will **deduct** points from your public score.
#
# For more details on what will cause you to lose points during code review and specific requirements, please take a look at the [Grading rubric](https://git.doit.wisc.edu/cdis/cs/courses/cs220/cs220-f23-projects/-/blob/main/p11/rubric.md).

# ### Verifying Laws of Nature:
#
# We will now use our dataset to verify some well-known laws of nature. Unless specified otherwise, you **must** use `stars_dict` and `planets_list` to access all data.

# #### Kepler's Third Law:
#
# We will first verify [Kepler's Third Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Third_law). This law states that the **square** of the `orbital_period` of each planet in a solar system is directly proportional to the **cube** of the `semi_major_radius` of its orbit around its host star.
#
# Since this law relates only to planets that orbit the same host star, we will verify this law using the several planets orbiting around a star named *GJ 9827*.

# **Question 1:** Compute the **ratio** of the **square** of the `orbital_period` to the **cube** of the `semi_major_radius` of each planet orbiting the star *GJ 9827*.
#
# Your output **must** be a **list** of **floats**. You may **assume** that the planets orbiting this star do not have any missing `orbital_period` or `semi_major_radius` data.

# +
# compute and store the answer in the variable 'ratios_gj9827', then display it
orbits = []
ratios_gj9827 = []
for planet in planets_list:
    if planet.host_name == "GJ 9827":
        orbits.append(planet)
for planet in orbits:
    ratios_gj9827.append((planet.orbital_period ** 2) / (planet.semi_major_radius ** 3))
    
ratios_gj9827
# -

grader.check("q1")

# The **ratios** of the three stars in this system appear to be very close to each other. It will be useful if we could quantify exactly how close these ratios are to each other. One way to do that would to be compute the [coefficient of variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coefficient_of_variation), which is defined as the **standard deviation** divided by the **mean** of a sequence of numbers. A low value would imply that the numbers are very **close** to each other.

# **Question 2:** Compute the **coefficient of variance** of the **list** `ratios_gj9827`.
#
# **Hint:** You can compute the **standard deviation** and the **mean** of a **list** of numbers using the `statistics.stdev` and `statistics.mean` functions inside the `statistics` module. To do this, you must first **import** the `statistics` module. You can read the documentation for the `statistics.stdev` and `statistics.mean` functions by creating a new cell and using `help(statistics.mean)` and `help(statistics.mean)`.

# +
# compute and store the answer in the variable 'coeff_gj9827', then display it
stdev = statistics.stdev(ratios_gj9827)
mean = statistics.mean(ratios_gj9827)

coeff_gj9827 = stdev / mean
coeff_gj9827
# -

grader.check("q2")

# As we can see, the **coefficient of variance** is indeed very low. This lends credibility to Kepler's Third Law. However, there is yet more we can do with this data. After we adjust for the units used in our dataset, we find that Kepler's Third Law predicts the following:
#
# $$\texttt{stellar mass} = \frac{133408}{\texttt{ratio}}$$
#
# where $\texttt{ratio}$ is the **mean** of the ratios of the **square** of the `orbital_period` to the **cube** of the `semi_major_radius` computed above, and $\texttt{stellar mass}$ is the mass of the planets' host star.
#
# We can therefore check how close this **predicted** `stellar_mass` is to the **actual** `stellar_mass` of the star.

# **Question 3:** Compute the percentage change of the **predicted** `stellar_mass` from the **actual** `stellar_mass` of the star *GJ 9827*.
#
# You **must** compute the **predicted** `stellar_mass` as the number *133408* divided by the **mean** of the ratios of the three planets computed in Question 1. You **must** find the **actual** `stellar_mass` by accessing the correct attribute of the `Star` object of *GJ 9827*. The percentage change can be computed as:
#
# $$\texttt{percent change} = \frac{\texttt{predicted stellar mass} - \texttt{actual stellar mass}}{\texttt{actual stellar mass}} \times 100$$

# +
# compute and store the answer in the variable 'percentage_change', then display it
predicted = 133408 / mean
actual = stars_dict["GJ 9827"].stellar_mass

percentage_change = ((predicted - actual) / actual) * 100
percentage_change

grader.check("q3")

# #### Stefan-Boltzmann Law:
#
# We will now verify the [Stefan-Boltzmann Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan%E2%80%93Boltzmann_law). This law states that the `insolation_flux` of a *black body* is directly proportional to the **fourth** power of the `equilibrium_temperature`. In our dataset, we have the `insolation_flux` and `equilibrium_temperature` data of the `Planet` objects. So, we can verify how well this law is obeyed by the planets in our dataset.

# **Question 4:** Create a **scatter plot** representing the `insolation_flux` (on the **x-axis**) against the **fourth power** of the `equilibrium_temperature` (on the **y-axis**) of each `Planet` object in `planets_list`.
#
# You **must** ignore all `Planet` objects with **missing** `insolation_flux`, or `equilibrium_temperature` data.
#
# You **must** first compute two **lists** containing the **insolation_flux**, and the fourth power of the **equilibrium_temperature** of each `Planet` object (which has all the data available). Then, you **must** use `plot_scatter` to plot the **insolation_flux** against the fourth power of the **equilibrium_temperature**.

# do NOT display or plot just yet

# ### Stellar Evolution:
#
# [Stellar Evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_evolution) is a description of the way that stars change with time. The primary factor determining how a star evolves is its `stellar_mass`. Depending on the `stellar_mass` of each `Star`, astronomers can predict how the `Star` will end up. A `Star` whose `stellar_mass` is $\geq 0.3$ and $< 8$ times the mass of the Sun will become a [Red Giant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_giant), while a `Star` whose `stellar_mass` is $\geq 8$ and $< 10.5$ times the mass of the Sun will become a [White Dwarf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf). A `Star` that is even bigger will end up as a [Neutron Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star).

# ### Data Structure 1: `star_classes`
#
# You **must** now classify the `Star` objects in `stars_dict` using their `stellar_mass`. You **must** create a **dictionary** `star_classes` with the **keys**: `Red Giant`, `White Dwarf`, and `Neutron Star`. The **value** of each **key** must be a **list** of **strings** containing the **names** of the `Star` objects.
#
# You **must** **ignore** `Star` objects for which we do not have `stellar_mass` data or have `stellar_mass` **less** than *0.3* Solar masses.
#
# **Hint:** Recall that the `stellar_mass` data already uses units of *Solar masses*. So, a `stellar_mass` of *1* means that the `Star` object has the same mass as the Sun, and a `stellar_mass` of 2 means the `Star` object has twice the mass of the Sun, and so on.

# define the variable 'star_classes' here
# but do NOT display

        elif mass < 10.5:

# Just as the different classes of `Star` objects have different **average luminosities**, they also have different **average densities**. This difference will be easier to visualize as a **scatter plot**.
#
# However, before you can do that, there is a minor hurdle you need to overcome - we do **not** have the *stellar density* data available for the `Star` objects in our dataset. However, we do have `stellar_mass` and `stellar_radius` data, which allows us to **compute** the *stellar density*. Since the `stellar_mass` and `stellar_radius` data is stored in units of the Sun's mass and radius respectively, we can compute the *stellar density* (i.e., density of the `Star` in units of the Sun's density) as follows:
#
# $$\texttt{stellar density} = \frac{\texttt{stellar mass}}{(\texttt{stellar radius})^{3}}.$$

# **Question 7:** Create a **scatter plot** representing the *stellar density* (on the **x-axis**) against the `stellar_luminosity` (on the **y-axis**) of each `Star` object of **each class** in `star_classes`.

# You **must** ignore all `Star` objects with **missing** `stellar_mass`, `stellar_radius`, or `stellar_luminosity` data.

# ### Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram:
#
# The [Hertzsprung–Russell diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertzsprung%E2%80%93Russell_diagram) is a scatter plot of stars showing the relationship between the stars' `stellar_luminosity` versus their `stellar_effective_temperature`. The diagram is exceedingly useful for understanding the stellar evolution of stars. We will now use the data we have available to plot this diagram ourselves, so we can better understand stellar evolution.
#
# We want to plot the `stellar_effective_temperature` against the `stellar_luminosity`, but more importantly, we will use the **color** and **size** parameters to represent the `stellar_age` and `stellar_mass` of the `Star` objects as well. This will allow us to see the effects of `stellar_age` and `stellar_mass` on `stellar_effective_temperature` and `stellar_luminosity`.

# **Question 9:** Create a **scatter plot** representing the `stellar_effective_temperature` (on the **x-axis**) against the `stellar_luminosity` (on the **y-axis**) of each `Star` object in `stars_dict`. Moreover, represent the `stellar_age` of each `Star` object using the **color** and represent the `stellar_mass` of each `Star` object using the **size** of the star.
#
# You **must** first compute four **lists** containing the `stellar_effective_temperature`, `stellar_luminosity`, `stellar_age` and the `stellar_mass` of each `Star` object (which has **all** the data available). You **must** ignore any `Star` object which has any of these four attributes **missing**. Then, you **must** use `plot_scatter` to plot the `stellar_effective_temperature` against the `stellar_luminosity` with the `stellar_age` as the **color** and the `stellar_mass` as the **size** of the points.

# first compute and store the lists 'temp_list', 'lum_list', 'age_list', and 'mass_list'
# do NOT plot just yet
temp_list = []
lum_list = []
age_list = []
mass_list = []
for star in stars_dict:
    if stars_dict[star].stellar_effective_temperature == None or stars_dict[star].stellar_luminosity == None or stars_dict[star].stellar_age == None or stars_dict[star].stellar_mass == None:
        continue
    else:
        temp_list.append(stars_dict[star].stellar_effective_temperature)
        lum_list.append(stars_dict[star].stellar_luminosity)
        age_list.append(stars_dict[star].stellar_age)
        mass_list.append(stars_dict[star].stellar_mass)

# Now, **plot** `temp_list` and `lum_list` as **scatter plot** with the **x-axis** labelled *Effective Temperature*, and the **y-axis** labelled *Luminosity*, **colored** using `age_list`, and **sized** using `mass_list`. Your plot should look like this:

# <div><img src="attachment:q9.png" width="400"/></div>

# **Hint:** If the `grader.export` cell fails to run because the file size is too large, you can delete the plot above to reduce the size of your notebook. Make sure your plot matches the plot above, before you do so.

# plot 'temp_list' and 'lum_list' with 'age_list' as colors and 'mass_list' as sizes
plot_scatter(temp_list, lum_list, "Effective Temperature", "Luminosity", c = age_list, s = mass_list)

# **Food for thought:** Can you tell if there is any relationship between the **temperature**, **luminosity**, **age**, and **mass** of the stars? You might want to remove the outliers with the extremely high `stellar_effective_temperature` to get a better view of the diagram. What effect does the **age** seem to have on the **temperature**? Recall that a **lighter** color implies that the value is higher, while a **darker** color implies that the value is lower. What effect does the **mass** have?
#
# **Food for thought:** Notice that there are **two distinct** *clusters* of points in this diagram. If you are interested, look up more information on the Hertzsprung–Russell Diagram to understand what these clusters are.

# ### Recursion:
#
# You are not done exploring the dataset, and you have more questions left to answer. However, something more important has happened! We have managed to find the data from the corrupted json file (`mapping_5.json`)!
#
# If you will recall, when we were parsing the files in P10, we found that `mapping_5.json` was **broken**, and we couldn't read it. Therefore, we had no choice but to leave all the planets in `planets_5.csv` out of our analysis. Luckily for you now, the data has shown up intact in the directory `broken_data`. Unfortunately, the data is now no longer stored in a single file, but has been **split up** into **multiple files** and stored in **different subdirectories**.
#
# You will now create a function to help parse all the data stored within this directory.

# ### Function 1:  `get_all_paths_in(directory)`
#
# You **must** write this function that takes in the **relative path** of a `directory` as its input, and returns a **list** of **relative paths** of all the **files** inside `directory` and its subdirectories.
#
# In other words, if a directory `sample_data` looks like this:
# ```
# +-- sample_data
# |   +-- .DS_Store
# |   +-- file_1.json
# |   +-- sample_1
# |   |   +-- .ipynb_checkpoints
# |   |   +-- file_2.json
# |   |   +-- file_3.json
# |   +-- sample_2
# |   |   +-- file_4.json
# |   |   +-- sample_3
# |   |   |   +-- .DS_Store
# |   |   |   +-- file_5.json
# ```
#
# then the output of the function call `get_all_paths_in("sample_data")` **must** be a **list** containing the **relative paths** of the files `file_5.json`, `files_4.json`, `file_3.json`, `file_2.json`, and `file_1.json`.
#
# You **must** **ignore** all files that start with `"."`, and your output **must** be **explicitly** sorted in **reverse alphabetical** order.
#
# **Important Warning:** You **must** write a **recursive** function here. You are **only allowed** to use the functions from the `os` module, which have been covered in lecture. Here is a list of these functions (you will only need a few of these functions to define `get_all_paths_in`):
# * `os.mkdir`
# * `os.path.join`
# * `os.listdir`
# * `os.path.exists`
# * `os.path.isfile`

We already have a function `get_planets` (from P10) which can read a CSV file and a JSON file and combine them to create a **list** of `Planet` objects. So, we can repeatedly call `get_planets` on the CSV file `planets_5.csv` and each of the JSON files inside `broken_data` to get a **list** of `Planet` objects of **all** the planets in `planets_5.csv`.
#
# You **must** **create** the **list** `all_planets_list` by adding in all `Planet` objects from `planets_list`, and then also adding in the `Planet` objects in `planets_5.csv` and the directory `broken_data`.
#
# **Hint:** You should loop through every file in the list `broken_data`, and use `get_planets` on `planets_5.csv` (inside the `data` directory), and this file (from the loop) to create a list of `Planet` objects, and then **extend** `all_planets_list` by the list of new `Planet` objects.
#
# **Warning:** Do **not** update the value of the **list** `planets_list` when you do this. Otherwise, your answers to some of the previous questions will become incorrect. Instead, make sure that the new `Planet` objects are only added to `all_planets_list` and **not** to `planets_list`.

# You can verify that you have not made any mistakes by confirming that `all_planets_list` now has *5526* `Planet` objects in it.

# ### Exploring habitability of exoplanets:
#
# Now that we have gathered the data on all the `Planet` objects, we are ready to have some fun with this dataset. Over the course of the rest of this project, we will try to find out if there are any planets in our dataset which could potentially support human habitation. Naturally, using the available data, we cannot say with any certainty that any particular planet is habitable, but we *can* say with some confidence when a planet is **not** habitable (notwithstanding major technological gains). That is exactly what we will do now.

# #### Surface Gravitational Force:
#
# It seems reasonable to expect that for humans to be able to survive on a planet, the gravitational force of the planet on its surface is not too different from that of the Earth.
#
# We note that the `planet_mass` and `planet_radius` attributes of the `Planet` objects stores these values in units of the mass of the Earth, and the radius of the Earth respectively. So, the **ratio** of the gravitational force experienced on the surface of a given planet to the force experienced on the surface of the Earth can be computed as:
#
# $$\frac{g_{\texttt{planet}}}{g_{\texttt{earth}}} = \frac{\texttt{planet mass}}{\texttt{planet radius}^{2}}$$
#
# So, a **ratio** greater than 1 would imply that a person on the planet's surface would experience a greater force due to gravity than on Earth, while a value lower than 1 would imply that a person on the planet's surface would experience a lesser force due to gravity than on Earth.

# ### Function 2: `get_surface_gravity(planet)`
#
# You **must** define this function which takes in a `Planet` object as its input, and then **returns** the **ratio** of the gravitational force experienced on the surface of a given planet to the force experienced on the surface of the Earth. If either the `planet_mass` or `planet_radius` data is **missing**, then your function **must** return `None`.

# define the function 'get_surface_gravity' here
def get_surface_gravity(planet):
    if planet.planet_mass == None or planet.planet_radius == None:
        return None
    return planet.planet_mass / (planet.planet_radius ** 2)

# #### Distance to the star:
#
# Planets follow **elliptical** orbits around their host star. The `eccentricity` of a planet's orbit is a number that measures *how* elliptical the orbit is. An eccentricity of *0* would imply that the orbit is in fact perfectly circular, while an eccentricity close to *1* would imply that the orbit is very skewed and elliptical. As you may expect, if a planet has a highly eccentric orbit, its distance to its host star would vary wildly, leading to a highly variable climate. To determine if a planet could support human habitation, it is therefore important to know the closest and shortest distances between the planet and its host star.
#
# We can compute these quantities using the attributes `eccentricity` and `semi_major_radius` of each `Planet` object. These distances can be computed as:
#
# $$\texttt{shortest distance} = \texttt{semi major radius} \times (1 - \texttt{abs}(\texttt{eccentricity}))$$
#
# $$\texttt{longest distance} = \texttt{semi major radius} \times (1 + \texttt{abs}(\texttt{eccentricity}))$$

# ### Function 3: `get_distances_to_star(planet)`
#
# You **must** define this function which takes in a `Planet` object as its input, and then **returns** a **list** of two **floats**. The first float should be the **shortest distance** of the `Planet` object to its host star, and the second float should be the **longest distance** to its host star. If either the `eccentricity` or `semi_major_radius` data of the `Planet` is missing, then the function **must** return `None`.

# #### Presence of Liquid Water :
#
# It is safe to say that planets which cannot sustain liquid are inhabitable. While we do not have any data on whether the `Planet` objects in our dataset have naturally occurring water, we are able to determine whether the planet can *support* liquid water based on its distance to its host star, and the luminosity of this star. 
#
# Astronomers have [computed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11536936/) that for Earth-like planets, there is a certain range of distances that a planet can have to its host star, which depends on the `luminosity` of the star, within which, water on the planet's surface can stay in liquid form. These distances are as follows:
#
# $$\texttt{liquid water shortest dist} = \sqrt{\frac{\texttt{absolute luminosity}}{1.15}}$$
#
# $$\texttt{liquid water longest dist} = \sqrt{\frac{\texttt{absolute luminosity}}{0.53}}$$
#
# In our dataset, the `stellar_luminosity` is stored in units of the logarithm of the absolute luminosity. So, the distances can be computed from our dataset as follows:
#
# $$\texttt{liquid water shortest dist} = \sqrt{\frac{10^{\texttt{stellar luminosity}}}{1.15}}$$
#
# $$\texttt{liquid water longest dist} = \sqrt{\frac{10^{\texttt{stellar luminosity}}}{0.53}}$$

# ### Function 4: `get_liquid_water_distances(planet)`
#
# You **must** define this function which takes in a `Planet` object as its input, and then **returns** a **list** of two **floats**. The first float should be the **shortest distance** the `Planet` object can be to its host star while being able to support liquid water, and the second float should be the **longest distance** it can be to its host star while being able to support liquid water. If the `stellar_luminosity` data of the host `Star` object is missing, then the function **must** return `None`.

# define the function 'get_liquid_water_distances' here
def get_liquid_water_distances(planet):
    lum = stars_dict[planet.host_name].stellar_luminosity

#
# **Hint:** You can find the actual shortest and longest distances of the planet with the `get_distances_to_star` function, and the shortest and longest distances at which liquid water can be supported with the `get_liquid_water_distances` function. You must consider `Planet` objects for which the actual distances to their host star lie **within** the distances at which liquid water can be supported.

# #### Surface temperature:
#
# The temperature on the surface of the planet is another important criteria for deciding whether a planet is habitable. The `equilibrium_temperature` of a `Planet` is the temperature that the planet would be, if it were a [black body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_body) (i.e., if it were able to absorb all the radiation it receives from its host star). However, most planets are not perfect black bodies and reflect some of the radiation that they receive from their host star. Astronomers use the quantity [albedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albedo) to measure how much radiation is reflected by the planet. An albedo of *0* implies that the planet is a perfect black body which absorbs all its radiation, while an albedo of *1* implies that the planet is perfectly reflective, and does not retain any radiation. In the real world, most planets have an albedo value between *0* and *0.5*.
#
# Using the albedo of a planet, we can compute the temperature on the surface of a planet as follows
#
# $$ \texttt{surface temperature} = \left(1- \texttt{albedo}\right) ^{1/4} \times \texttt{equilibrium temperature}$$
#
# Unfortunately, we do **not** have the albedo values of the `Planet` objects in our dataset. So, we will instead make some educated guesses and find the **maximum** and **minimum** surface temperatures, assuming that the albedo is within the range of *0* to *0.5* (which is known to be the case for most planets).

# ### Function 5: `get_surface_temperatures(planet)`
#
# You **must** define this function which takes in a `Planet` object as its input, and then **returns** a **list** of two **floats**. The first float should be the **minimum surface temperature** of the `Planet` object (which can be computed by assuming a **albedo** value of *0.5*), and the second float should be the **maximum surface temperature** (which can be computed by assuming a **albedo** value of *0.0*). If the `equilibrium_temperature` data of the `Planet` is missing, then the function **must** return `None`.

# #### Putting it all together:
#
# We are finally ready to combine all our various criteria of habitability to make a list of planets which satisfy all the criteria above, and could potentially be habitable.

So, allowing for some technological improvements in the future, we will make more modest requests of the planets in our dataset.

# 2. The planet must always **lie within** the range at which it is able to support liquid water.
# 3. The **minimum** surface temperature must be **greater** than *200* and the **maximum** surface temperature must be **less** than *350*.
